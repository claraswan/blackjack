This is my biggest Python project to date. I created a simple blackjack game for the terminal in which one user plays against the "House". This program will be a work in progress. The base program is a simplified version of blackjack. The game currently does not allow for betting, and the cards are simply numbers from 1-11. 
This game was a lot of fun to create and I am excited to continue adding functionality to it!
